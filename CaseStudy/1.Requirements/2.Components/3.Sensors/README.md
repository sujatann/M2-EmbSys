There are various sensors used while designing the refrigerator.
Which includes,
•	Dual Sensor Control with Two Thermo Sensor Controls which enable to increase or decrease the temperature in Freezer & Fridge zone independently.
•	 A reed sensor or Hall effect sensor can be used to detect the door's position. For example, in refrigerators, a reed sensor is mounted to the frame of the appliance and a permanent magnet actuator is mounted to the door

Actuators:
* A refrigerator actuator or water dispenser consists of a paddle-shaped lever that releases ice or water. When the water dispenser lever will not work or depressing the lever causes little to no water flow, there may be air in the water dispenser supply lines or a broken lever mechanism that needs to be replaced.
