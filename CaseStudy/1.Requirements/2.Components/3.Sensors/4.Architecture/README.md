## Design.
o	Embedded within a domestic Fridge compartment is an Evaporator, and
on the outside a Condenser, heat exchanging coils and the refrigerant
compressor. 
o	The compressor is driven by an electrical motor. 
When power is applied to the compressor the pressure of the refrigerant is
     increased. 
o	This increase in pressure causes an increase in refrigerant
temperature and the heat produced by this action is dissipated through
the heat exchanging coils at the rear of the appliance. 
This action is illustrated in the above diagram.
o	The refrigerant then condenses and passes through from the
high-pressure environment of the condenser through an expansion
valve to the low-pressure evaporation system inside the Fridge
compartment. 
o	On evaporating, the refrigerant absorbs heat and
subsequently reduces the enclosure temperature. 
o	The warmer refrigerant is circulated to the outside of the compartment where the cycle repeats under thermal control.


## Working:
The basic principle is that whenever a liquid coolant is passed through things at a higher temperature, it absorbs the heat; gets evaporated and the cooling effect is produced. The Refrigerator works on the principle of evaporation.

i.e When the temperature of the fridge compartment rises above the pre-selected thermostat setting, the bi-metallic contact closes and line voltage is applied to both the start and run windings simultaneously. The start winding has a lower resistance than the run winding and provides the initial current surge required to start the motor. This inrush of current subsequently raises the temperature of the PTC and increases its resistive property, which in turn reduces the current flow to the start
winding. At this point in time, the current through the start winding has been minimised by the PTC, the current through the run winding is stable and the motor continues to run. When the fridge compartment reaches the desired temperature the thermostat contact opens, removing power from the motor. When the compartment air temperature again rises, the temperature control cycle repeats.
