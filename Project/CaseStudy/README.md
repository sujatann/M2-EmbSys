## Introduction:
 * Firstly, we need to understand what does a refrigerator means.
- A refrigerator is an open system that dispels heat from a closed space to a warmer area, usually a kitchen or another room. By dispelling the heat from this area, it decreases in temperature, allowing food and other items to remain at a cool temperature.

 ** So,as we now know what does the refrigerator means its now necessary to know its function.
 The main function process is refrigeration.Refrigeration is the process of removing heat from an area or a substance. It is usually done by an artificial means of lowering the temperature, such as by the use of ice or mechanical refrigeration, which is a mechanical system or apparatus, designed and constructed to transfer heat from one substance to another.
