There are various sensors used while designing the refrigerator.
Which includes,
•	Dual Sensor Control with Two Thermo Sensor Controls which enable to increase or decrease the temperature in Freezer & Fridge zone independently.
•	 A reed sensor or Hall effect sensor can be used to detect the door's position. For example, in refrigerators, a reed sensor is mounted to the frame of the appliance and a permanent magnet actuator is mounted to the door

Actuators:

* Compressor power relay.
The purpose of this relay is to apply power to the compressor motor start and run windings at power-on, and maintain power to the motor run winding after the start-up phase has expired. Additionally, as the relay contact has a low resistance, it does not dissipate power unnecessarily under normal running conditions.

* A thermostatic actuator .
It acts as a valve actuator to open or close a valve based on a temperature setpoint to. i.e The regulating system, consists of thermostatic valve means for controlling the flow of refrigerant to the evaporator having an actuator chamber filled with a refrigerant medium having liquid an vapor phases, and electrical heat supply element in the actuator chamber.
