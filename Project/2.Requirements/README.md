There are mainly two types of requirements,namely;

1.High level requirements.

2.Low level requirements.
Table of Requirements.


 Though both the types of requirements are more or less depended on each other while functioning, according to the need and   usage there are termed as high and low.

1. High level requirements.
•	The  primary requirement is that within less amount  of time it should serve the purpose in cooling the things.
•	Maintaining  refrigerated foods at a low temperature which helps to slow the growth of microorganisms, so thus reduces the occurances of foodborne illness and also to retain the nutritional qualities of food.
 
2. Low level requirements
•	Power consumption must be as less as possible.
•	The depth of the refrigerator should be more in order to place as many as items /things and more space for airflow.


##  High level requirements.
|   Id	   |          High level requirements.                              |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  HLR1	   | The system shall maintain the temperature in the required limit.|
|  HLR2	   | The system shall have control over alarm conditions.|
|  HLR3	   | The system shall be able to keep a track on compressor control.|

## Low level requirements.
|     Id	   |     Low level requirements.  |
|------------|------------------------------|
|  LLR1.1(for HLR1)	| From initial power-on, the ambient air temperature of the fridge is typically around +21°C.|
|  LLR1.2(for HLR1)	| The user selected temperature is typically setaround +5°C, and may cycle between +8 and +2°C.|
|  LLR2.1(For HLR2)	| There are three possible alarm situations. These are, door open, over, or under temperature conditions.|
|  LLR2.2(For HLR2)	| If the door has inadvertently been opened for a pre-determined time, for example, one minute, an audible alarm will be sounded.|
|  LLR2.3(For HLR2)	| The over temperature situation can occur if the fridge door is not closed properly or there is compressor failure or a refrigerant pressure problem.|
|  LLR2.4(For HLR2)	| The under temperature case may occur if the compressor is permanently powered-on. In all of these situations the objective is to alert the user.|
|  LLR3.1(For HLR3)	| A conventional compressor control case, a more efficient and long-term cost-effective solution can be implemented using the microcontroller to control the compressor motor using a triac and a relay.|
|  LLR3.2(For HLR3)	| The purpose of this relay is to apply power to the compressor motor start and run windings at power-on.|
|  LLR3.3(For HLR3) | And also to maintain power to the motor run winding after the start-up phase has expired.|
